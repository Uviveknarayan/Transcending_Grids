## Installation
Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Uviveknarayan/Transcending_Grids.git
```

## Running Experiments
We provide code to reproduce the main results in Jupyter Notebook files.
```
1. Run the OFFconversion file with chosen strategy(Triangle or Square) for an image dataset.
2. Use the obtained OFF files as dataset to run the jupyter notebooks and obtain results.
```
